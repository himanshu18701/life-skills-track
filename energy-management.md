## Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points, only the points.

* Immediate Benefits: Exercise boosts neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline, enhancing mood, focus, and reaction times right after a single workout.

* Long-term Changes: Regular exercise increases the volume of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, improving long-term memory, attention, and overall brain function.

* Protective Effects: Exercise strengthens the brain areas most vulnerable to aging and neurodegenerative diseases, delaying the impact of conditions like dementia and Alzheimer's.

* Minimal Requirements: To achieve these benefits, aim for aerobic exercise three to four times a week, for at least 30 minutes per session.

* Accessible Options: Exercise doesn't require a gym membership; activities like walking, taking stairs, and power-vacuuming can be just as effective.
