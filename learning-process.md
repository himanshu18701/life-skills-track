# Learning Process


## What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a method that involves explaining a concept in a simple way to make it easy to understand even for a kid, identifying gaps in understanding, and improving the explanation until it is clear.


## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison harnessed their diffused state of thinking by allowing their thoughts to run wild before sleep, then using methods to wake up and capture these creative ideas for their innovations or paintings.


## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active mode is a focused, analytical way of thinking for detailed problem-solving, while diffused mode is a relaxed, big-picture way of thinking that promotes creativity and insights.


## Steps to take when approaching a new topic.

* Deconstuct the skill - Decide what you want to be able to do when you are done and based on that break it down in smaller piecies.

* Learn enough to self-correct - Learn just enough so that you can actually self-correct.

* Remove practice barriers

* Practice at least 20 hours


## What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

* Apply Feynman Technique to every new concept that I am learning.

* Work to learn, not to complete

* Apply the Pomodoro method technique in the learning part i.e. 25 minutes of focused learning and 5 minutes of fun activity.

* Remove barriers like mobile while learning.
