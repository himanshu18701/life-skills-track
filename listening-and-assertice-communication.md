# Listening and Active Communication

## What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?
* Avoid getting distracted by your thoughts.
* Focus on the speaker and topic.
* Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them finish and then respond
* Use door openers. These are phrases that show you are interested and keep the other person talking.
* Show that you are listening with body language.
* If appropriate take notes during important conversations.
* Paraphrase what others have said to make sure you are on the same page.


## According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

* Empathy, acceptance, congruence, and concreteness help make good reflective responses
* Reflective responses contribute to the development and perception of the listening orientation.
* More listening than talking.
* Respond to personal things rather than impersonal, distant, or abstract things.
* Restate and clarify what the other person says, instead of asking questions or sharing your feelings, beliefs, or wants.
* Try to understand the feelings behind what the other person is saying, not just the facts or ideas.
* Work hard to see things from the other person's perspective, not your own.
* Responding with acceptance and empathy, not with indifference, cold objectivity, or fake concern.
