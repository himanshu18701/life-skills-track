# Good Practices for Software Development

## Which point(s) were new to you?

* Tracking time to improve the Productivity.
* Don't send queries in the form of bombarding messages instead write all queries in a single message
* Get to know the team members for better coordination.
* If I want an answer to my question don't just provide a rough question Explain the problem clearly, mention the solutions I have tried to fix the problem, and use screenshots, and diagrams.


## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

### Improving communication between team members.
* Active Listening: Ensure that I actively listen to team members during meetings or discussions to better understand their perspectives and concerns.

* Proactive Communication: Initiate more frequent updates and check-ins with team members, both individually and as a group, to ensure everyone is on the same page and any potential issues are addressed promptly.

* Clarify Expectations: Clearly communicate expectations regarding deadlines, project goals, and individual responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings and ensure alignment within the team.

* Utilize Collaboration Tools: Leverage collaboration tools like Slack, Trello, or Asana to facilitate communication, share updates, and track progress on tasks and projects.

* Seek Feedback: Actively seek feedback from team members on my communication style and areas for improvement, and be open to making necessary adjustments based on their input.

### To improve in asking questions when stuck, I can:

* Refine Questioning Skills: Focus on asking clear, concise, and specific questions that provide enough context for others to understand the issue and offer meaningful assistance.

* Explore Solutions Independently: Before reaching out for help, make a concerted effort to troubleshoot and explore potential solutions independently. This demonstrates initiative and problem-solving skills while also potentially uncovering the solution without external assistance.

* Document Learnings: Keep a record of the solutions or approaches that have been successful in resolving similar issues in the past. This can serve as a reference for future challenges and reduce reliance on repetitive questions.

### Principle of "work when you work and play when you play," I can:

* Establish Boundaries: Set clear boundaries between work and personal time to ensure that I remain focused and productive during designated work hours and fully disconnect during breaks or leisure time.

* Minimize Distractions: Implement strategies to minimize distractions during work hours, such as disabling non-essential notifications, utilizing productivity apps to block distracting websites, and creating a dedicated workspace conducive to concentration.

* Prioritize Self-Care: Incorporate regular breaks, physical activity, and relaxation techniques into my routine to maintain energy levels and mental well-being throughout the day.
